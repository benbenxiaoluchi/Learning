                The Learn app, part of Accenture Connected Learning, is an enhanced version of previous learning apps and is designed to help the user view all the learning we have available in one place—pulling content from other tools such as Learning Boards, myLearning, Professional Communities and more. It also recommends new roles for you to consider and opportunities for developing skills to meet business priorities, through its integration with our Accenture Careers Marketplace, myScheduling and Career Planning tools.

                One of the highlights of this version of the Learn app is also a personalized Learning Action Plan section. The user can add learning items to their Action Plan and track their progress through the Action Plan section of the app.
